# Welcome to My Developer Portfolio

Hello! I'm Noam Kyram, a computer science student at Reichman University. Over the past few years, I've worked on a variety of projects that showcase my skills in software development, web technologies, and data analysis. This portfolio is a collection of my best work, demonstrating my ability to turn ideas into functional, scalable, and efficient solutions.

## üìÅ Project Highlights

### [Project Overview - Code Something](https://github.com/noamkyr/code_something-_final_project_Noam_Kyram.git)
Code Something is an interactive platform for programming challenges designed to strengthen algorithmic thinking using LLM-powered feedback.
A challenge involves two users:
  1.	User A implements a function in a chosen source language and verifies it.
  2.	User A sends the code to User B as a challenge.
  3.	User B first writes a free-text explanation of what the code does.
  The system‚Äôs LLM verifies the accuracy of this description.
  4.	Upon a correct description, User B must reimplement the same logic in the target language.
  The result is verified using LLM scoring and unit tests.
  If both steps pass, both players earn a point.

**Key Features**

‚Ä¢ Dynamic Flowchart Generation:  
  Real-time visualization of the code‚Äôs control flow using pyflowchart, Graphviz, and language-specific converters (for Python, JavaScript, and C#).  
  This helps users debug, reason, and explain logic visually.

‚Ä¢ Daily ‚ÄúStudent C‚Äù Challenge:  
  Presents code that looks correct but hides a conceptual flaw.  
  Players must identify the mistake in logic - testing deeper comprehension.

‚Ä¢ LLM-Based Code Evaluation:  
  Uses a locally hosted model (qwen2.5-coder) through llama_cpp to assess code implementations and textual explanations according to accuracy, clarity, and alignment with the given mission.  
  It also provides a numeric grade based on different parameters.

‚Ä¢ Monaco Editor Integration:
