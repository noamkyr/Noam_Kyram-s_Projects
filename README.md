# Welcome to My Developer Portfolio

Hello! I'm Noam Kyram, a computer science student at Reichman University. Over the past few years, I've worked on a variety of projects that showcase my skills in software development, web technologies, and data analysis. This portfolio is a collection of my best work, demonstrating my ability to turn ideas into functional, scalable, and efficient solutions.

## üìÅ Project Highlights

### [Noam's Jersey Shop](https://github.com/noamkyr/noams_jerseys_store)
This project, Noam's Jersey Shop, was developed as my final full-stack project course. It is an online store for NBA jerseys, built from scratch using Node.js, Express, and client-side in JavaScript, CSS, HTML. The project demonstrates backend design, RESTAPI development, and session authentication and management using persistent cookies. On the frontend, it features dynamic rendering, responsive layouts, and advanced user interactions such as a wishlist system with personal notes, product reviews, and real-time currency conversion (USD and NIS). Additional functionality includes NBA statistics pages powered by external APIs, administrative tools for product management and activity tracking, and automated test scripts that validate all server routes and edge cases.

### [Real-time multi-method e-commerce scraper](https://github.com/noamkyr/Hw3_Ex1_Noam_Kyram.git)
Allows users to compare product data from Amazon, BestBuy, and Walmart. The system features a javascript frontend connected to a FastAPI backend written in Python. It supports three scraping methods: Basic Scraping using requests and BeautifulSoup for structured HTML extraction, LLM Scraping using LLM models using OpenRouter to intelligently parse complex HTML and extract product details), and Firecrawl API Scraping. The scraper dynamically retrieves and displays product information including title, price, rating, and review count in a simple, responsive table. In addition, it includes a product recommendation feature powered by an LLM that suggests related products based on the user‚Äôs recent search history.

This project is demonstrating the integration of web automation, AI reasoning, and modern backend-frontend communication.


### [Table Tennis Analyzer](https://github.com/noamkyr/Hw2_ex1_Noam_Kyram_Table_Tennis_Analyzer.git)
A computer-vision system that automatically tracks and analyzes players in a table-tennis match using YOLO pose estimation, OpenCV, and EasyOCR. The program detects players in each frame of a match video, draws bounding boxes and pose joints, filters invalid frames, and records the player coordinates into a CSV file. It generates a heatmap of player movement patterns and a score-progress chart visualizing how each player‚Äôs performance evolves throughout the match. In addition, it calculates and displays real-time player speeds between score changes, showing the average movement intensity both on the video overlay and directly on the score chart.


### [Special Icy Tower](https://github.com/noamkyr/Hw1_ex2_Noam_Kyram.git)
This project is a special version of the classic "Icy Tower" game, fully developed in JavaScript using HTML Canvas. The game now includes a scoring system that rewards faster climbs, platforms that collapse after being stood on for several seconds, moving platforms (both vertically and horizontally), and two types of animated enemies. I also introduced power-ups such as a star granting temporary invincibility, a spring that launches the player higher, collectible coins, and a unique zero-gravity boost that alters gameplay physics for a limited time. The game features visual upgrades with custom image assets, sound effects, background music, and a leaderboard system that tracks top scores. 

### [The quest for the Epsilon cup game](https://github.com/noamkyr/Hw3_trivia_game.git)
This project is a full-stack real-time multiplayer trivia game combining a FastAPI backend, Socket.IO communication, and a Next.js frontend. It features live multiplayer gameplay with synchronized questions, scoring, and chat. The question database was generated and validated automatically using multiple LLMs (Gemini / Gemma) to ensure uniqueness, balanced difficulty, and accuracy across ten categories. Additional scripts integrate hint generation and adaptive validation through AI pipelines. Players can choose their character (Archer or Warrior) and use strategic power-ups such as 50-50, Double Points, Triple Points, and Call a Friend (hint reveal). A real-time leaderboard updates after every round.
